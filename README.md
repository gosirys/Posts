# What 
This is a temporary dump of posts I eventually plan to publish on a proper site. 

# Why
1. Their content could accidentally turn to be useful to someone
2. Archiving/documenting purposes
3. To have material to go through in *nostalgic* mode should I ever get old

# Disclaimer
Some content can be relatively outdated as could date as far as the pre-2010 era.

## [01. Turning a Blind SQLi into Union-based with a 2-in-1 Payload](https://github.com/gosirys/Posts/blob/master/Turning-a-Blind-SQLi-into-Union-based-with-a-2-in-1-Payload.md)
How not being lucid made me want to turn and exploit an SQL Injection from Boolean-Blind to Union-based by crafting a 2-in-1 Payload.
 
The exploit was accomplished by leveraging a first SQL Injection to alter and weaponize the output of the first vulnerable into a carrier for a 2nd SQL Injection on a second vulnerable query all through a single injection point (parameter) - hence the *2-in-1 Payload*.
