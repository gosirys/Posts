# What 
This is a temporary dump of posts I eventually plan to publish on a proper site. 

# Why
1. Their content could accidentally turn to be useful to someone
2. Archiving/documenting purposes
3. To have material to go through in *nostalgic* mode should I ever get old

# Disclaimer
Some content can be relatively outdated as could date as far as the pre-2010 era.
